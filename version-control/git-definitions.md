# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* **What is version control?  Why is it useful? ** Version control allows us to track progress, review and revert changes, and create backups.

* **What is a branch and why would you use one? ** A branch makes a copy of the project that can be worked on. A branch can be made for different features of something. 

* **What is a commit? What makes a good commit message? ** A commit is a save point for the project. A good commit message describes the changes made in detail since the last commit. 

* **What is a merge conflict? ** A merge conflict can occur when making two or more people are making changes to the same file. An example of this would be if one person deletes a line of code and another person chooses to modify that same line of code in a different way. If this happens, Git marks the file as having a conflict.
